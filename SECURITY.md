# Security Policy

MyPowerShell is a PowerShell environment configuration tool that downloads and installs third-party software from the internet. This document outlines the security measures implemented and considerations for users.

## Security Measures

### 1. Package Manager Security
All tools are installed via trusted package managers:
- **winget**: Microsoft's official Windows package manager
- **scoop**: Community-maintained package manager with verified manifests
- **PowerShell Gallery**: Official Microsoft module repository (PSFzf)

The installer:
- Uses only official package manager commands
- Does **not** download executables directly
- Verifies package existence before installation
- Falls back to scoop if winget fails

### 2. No Administrator Privileges Required
- **User-Level Installation**: All tools install to user directories (`~\scoop\`)
- **No UAC Prompts**: Installation runs without elevation
- **Profile Modification**: Only modifies user's PowerShell profile (`$PROFILE`)
- **Config Files**: Deployed to user's home directory (`~\.config\`)

### 3. Error Handling Strategy
- **Pragmatic Approach**: Warns on errors but continues installation
- **Graceful Degradation**: Missing tools are skipped, not fatal
- **Status Reporting**: Clear feedback on success/failure for each component
- **Non-Destructive**: Existing configurations are overwritten but not deleted

### 4. Code Quality
- **UTF-8 Encoding**: All scripts use UTF-8 with BOM for PowerShell compatibility
- **Error Action Preference**: Uses `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` for optional features
- **Input Validation**: User responses validated before use
- **Quoted Paths**: All file paths properly quoted to handle spaces

### 5. Configuration File Safety
- **Automatic Overwrites**: Configs overwrite existing files without prompting (by design)
- **Version Control**: Tracked in git for easy rollback
- **Cross-Platform Configs**: starship.toml and delta.gitconfig copied from MyBash
- **JSON Merging**: Windows Terminal settings are merged, not replaced

## Security Considerations for Users

### Trust Chain

This installer relies on the security of:
- **winget/scoop**: Package manager integrity and manifest verification
- **GitHub**: For hosting this repository
- **PowerShell Gallery**: For PSFzf module
- **HTTPS/TLS**: For secure transmission
- **DNS**: For domain name resolution

### Recommended Practices

1. **Review Before Running**: Always read `install.ps1` before executing
2. **Run on Trusted Networks**: Avoid running installer on untrusted/public networks
3. **Backup Profile**: Backup existing `$PROFILE` before installation
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item $PROFILE "$PROFILE.backup"
   ```
4. **Git Tracking**: Keep mypowershell directory in git for easy rollback

### What the Installer Modifies

- **PowerShell Profile**: Adds MyPowerShell hook to `$PROFILE`
- **Config Files**: Deploys to `~\.config\` (starship.toml)
- **Windows Terminal**: Merges Tokyo Night theme into settings.json
- **Git Config**: Optionally includes delta.gitconfig (user prompted)
- **Environment**: No system PATH modifications (scoop handles this)

## Known Limitations

1. **Package Manager Trust**: Security depends on winget/scoop manifest integrity
2. **Third-Party Tools**: Security depends on upstream projects (starship, zoxide, etc.)
3. **Auto-Overwrite**: Configs overwrite without confirmation (intentional design choice)
4. **Windows Terminal Detection**: Auto-detects WT settings path (may fail on non-standard installations)

## Privacy

MyPowerShell does **not**:
- Send telemetry or analytics
- Connect to external servers (except package managers during installation)
- Collect user data
- Modify system-level settings
- Require online activation

Individual tools (starship, zoxide, etc.) may have their own telemetry - consult their documentation.
